# Information-Retrieval-Systems-and-Language-Embeddings

### Performed Preprocessing of documents in the dataset and using these preprocessed documents Implemented various IR systems like, Boolean retrieval system, a system from the Tf-Idf family with appropriate forms for the functions and tuned parameters (query being matched using cosine similarity), and a system of BM25.
### Performed word similarity task using pre trained word vectors for GloVe, Word2Vec and FastText.
### Implemented N-gram model to find most frequently used words,letters and syllables in the language.
### Used the pre-trained IndicBERT model available from AI4Bharat https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indic-bert/ and fine-tuned it using the NER task.
