# Information-Retrieval-Systems-and-Language-Embeddings

### Performed word similarity task using pre trained word vectors for GloVe, Word2Vec and FastText.
### Implemented N-gram model to find most frequently used words,letters and syllables in the language.
### Used the pre-trained IndicBERT model available from AI4Bharat https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indic-bert/ and fine-tuned it using the NER task.
